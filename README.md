### Maldrasen 
A former front end developer, now retired and working as a full time pornography engineer and all around lewdsmith. This has mostly taken the form of starting projects, working obsessivly on them, and then abandoning them when I realize that everything that I had planned would take literal decades to complete. I've recently started a new project, a lewd dungeon crawler inspired by the old Wizardry games. I'm really trying to not let scope creep bite me on the ass this time, but we'll see how that goes.

Currently Working On:
  - [Rhysh](https://github.com/maldrasen/rhysh): A lewd Wizardry-like
